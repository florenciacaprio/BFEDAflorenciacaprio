GIT
Git is a version control system. What is a version control system? These are software tools that help manage changes to source code.  Git is very useful if you want to collaborate with other developers.
Repositories: A Git repositories contains all of the project files.
GitHub is a hosting site for software development where you can host your Git projects in the cloud.
Commands
You can either type by hand the commands in the terminal or use a GUI (graphical user interface).
Most common commands
Git init: Turns a directory into an empty git repository.
Git add: adds files in the staging area for git.
Git commit: Records the changes made to the files to a local repository.
Git status: returns the current state of the repository.
Git config: Is used to assign settings.
Git branch: To know what branch the local repository is on, add or delete a new branch.
Git checkout: Used to switch branches.
Git merge: Merges branches together.
Git stash: Temporarily stashes changes made to the working copy so you can also work on something else and re apply them later.	
Commit
Is a version of the project and has a reference to all the files and folders that are part of it.
Working directory: Directory = folder. Here you can add, edit and delete projects in the project.
Staging area: Here you can have a draft of your project. You can add or remove files so is easier to choose what to include in your next commit.
Commit story: Is where the commits is stored after being made.
Branch
A branch is a pointer to a commit. The default name for a branch is “master”.
Tags
Git has two types of tags: lightweight and annotated. The first one just like branches doesn’t change. Annotated tags on the other hand are stored as full objects in the git database. 
Hooks
Hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain events occur in a git repository. Hooks are only executed in response to actions that happen in the repository they reside, they can reside in either local or server side repositories.
